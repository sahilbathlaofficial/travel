### Day 0 (Delhi - Manali)

We took an overnight outstation taxi from Delhi - Manali. We left around 9 pm in the night of 14th June 2018 and reached around 1 pm in the morning.

### Day 1 (Manali - Mori Dugh Camp - 5-6km)

After reaching Manali we first went to a camp owned by the organizers of the trek and quickly took a shower and started our trek at around 2:30 pm. The starting point was near shop number 77 on Manali-Rohtang road. This is where we started -

It was not even 15 minutes into the trek and it started to drizzle. Unfortunately, I didn't bring my raincoat & not even an umbrella. The slow drizzle quickly turned into a heavy shower. I was carrying a lot of electronics including my phone, Fitbit, power bank & my laptop (courtesy to my remote job). Having nothing to protect them I handed over my phone & Fitbit band to my friend who kept them in his *waterproof* jacket and tucked my power bank & laptop in my bag after wrapping in two polythenes. But the rain was too heavy and we got drenched but we didn't stop trekking. It was a weird moment, on one hand, I feared to catch a cold and on another hand, I was enjoying the rain and cool breeze that came with it.

It took us 3 hours(around 5:30 pm) to reach our campsite Mori Dugh Camp. The route was a mix of rocky & muddy patches. Here is the picture of our campsite. The best thing about our campsite were these wooden swings that hung on a huge tree -

After offloading our stuff, we took our clothes out so that they can dry but the sun was down soon after. By that time I had realized that my friend's jacket was not so waterproof and both the phones in his pocket were pretty much dead. We spent the night trying to dry our shoes and clothes near the campfire hoping that we could trek the following day. I had to take a medicine for headache thanks to our trekking in rain in the morning

### Day 2 (Mori Dugh Camp - Bhrigu Summit - Mori Dugh Camp - 10-11km)

We woke up early at around 6:00 am, got ready & head breakfast and headed for the trek around 6:30-6:45 am. The route to the lake was pretty awesome, a lot of meadows and beautiful trees in between. You could just stop anywhere to take good pictures. We had company for this hike as two dogs decided to join us. Here is a picture with one of our companion -

The last stretch introduced snow and a definite drop in oxygen level as we did face some difference in breathing. But it didn't last long before we reached the lake. Here is how the lake looked that day -

It took us about 4.5 hours to reach the lake (around 5.5km) although we expected more. After having lunch there and taking many pictures we started our descent around 11:30 am & it only took us 3 hours to reach back to our base camp. Rest of the day was pretty much about resting, eating & sleeping :).

### Day 3 (Mori Dugh Camp - Manali - Delhi)

Instead of going back to Vashisht we decided to head back to our starting point. We wanted to avoid heavy traffic in Manali as it was the end of a long weekend. But I will recommend going to Vashish especially if you have time and fancy some hot springs. It took us 3 hours to reach back to our starting point. We started around 7 am and reach around 10 am. After that? Delhi :).
