This is another great weekend trek one can do in North India (specially if you're from Delhi). I guess that is why I did it twice :D. Just a word of caution, It is not one of the beautiful trek and is a about a 10-12 hours overnight drive from Delhi so be prepared to trek in the following morning.

### Quick Synopsis

*Trek Difficulty* - Easy to Moderate<br/>
*Trek Duration* - 2 days<br/>
*Trek Distance* - 8km Panthwari Village - Nag Tibba Summit<br/>
*Trek Beauty* - 2.5/5 stars<br/>

### Day 0 (Delhi - Panthwari Village)

We booked a mini bus/traveller and did a overnight journey from Delhi. We left around 11pm in night and reached about 9 am in Panthwari Village which has 1 and most used out of the 3 possible routes to Nag Tibba Summit.

### Day 1 (Panthwari Village - Goat Village - 2.5km)

After reaching there we all quickly freshened up and had breakfast at a shop near the start of the trail. Picture of the starting point -

We headed out at around 10:00 am and were expecting to reach our campsite in 4-5 hours. As I had done this trek previously I was expecting the camp site to be same as last time. It was near the Nag Tibba temple which was about 2km before the summit. But to my amaze we only treked for about 2-2:30 hours and reached our campsite at about 12:30 am. The terrain was mainly rocky. A motorable alternative was there for about an hour or so of our ascend. I remember passing at least 4-5 roads vertically.

The camp site was just before the goat village. The distance covered was only about 2.5km. The guide we hired suggested that there is snow near the temple so we can't camp there and also that doing summit won't be possible due to melting snow that is covering the trail. A bit disappointed by this news we accepted it

We had lunch that was prepared by our guides and then went on to sleep in afternoon. In evening we were served with tea & pakoras and was followed by dinner which even had chicken in the menu. It was certainly feeeling more of picnic instead of a trek at this point. We all did some stargazing in the night before calling it a day. This is how our lunch table near camp site looked like -

### Day 2 (Goat Village - Nag Tibba Summit - Panthwari Village - 13.5km)

We woke up at 6-6:30 but left only around 7:30 for the temple after having breakfast. The trail from here was more flatten and easy to do compared to day 1. It only took us about 2.5 hours (10:00 am) to reach the temple and we were surprised to see only few patches of snow here and there near the temple. Not satisfied with what we had, we decided to go to the summit even though the guide was strictly against it. Here is the picture of the temple for reference

We started our ascend as I knew the way from my previous visit. The guide followed us after realising that we were going to do it with or without him. The route was steep and yes it had decent amount of snow in the trail but that is what we came for. It took us about an hour(11:00 am) before we reached the summit. We stopped many times to get ourselves clicked in the snowy patches. Here is one the picture -

The summit was great and we made sure to spend some time there and get ourselves clicked. Here is one of the pictures of the summit -

My friends decided that they were not done with snow and went on to slide in one of the patch. Have a look -

So around 11:45 we started our descent and it took as about 2:30 hours(2:15pm) to reach back to our camp site. After grabbing lunch we started our descend at around 3pm and reached back to Panthware village around 4:30pm. From there we just crashed into our traveller and started our journey back to our home.
