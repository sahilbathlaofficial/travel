This is Ijen, one of majestic sight that Indonesia has to offer and the reason we picked east Java of all places to visit. We were so excited to visit this <strong>electric-blue sulphur breathing</strong> beauty. But unfortunately it closed down during our visit due to some toxic gases that leaked from the crater. At Least a dozen of local people were hospitalized. Nonetheless it remains in my wishlist for future. For now let‚Äôs talk about other scenic beauties that Java had to offer :)

### Day 1 (Delhi - Surabaya - Mount Bromo)

We took the cheapest Airasia flight available on 28th March 2018. We left around 11:45 pm from Delhi Airport and reached Surabaya International Airport after our transit from Kuala Lumpur at around 10:45 am. We had friends coming from Singapore and Bangalore and we all met at Carl's Junior. Our guide for next 3 days (Mr Hamim) also met us there and after having breakfast we started our journey towards our <strong>first destination i.e Mount Bromo</strong>. Here is a pic taken by Mr Hamim of our group on arrival -

It was a <strong>5-6 hour drive</strong> from the airport. This part of Indonesia didn't feel much different than any other beach city in India. Only difference were the people & cleanliness which was way better than India. It was a bit surprising considering the fact that Indonesia is way behind India in terms of economy.

We reached our hotel <strong>Bromo Permai</strong> at about 6pm. Mr Hamim informed that we will be visiting the sunrise point of <strong>mount bromo at 2:15 am</strong>. So without wasting much time we went to have early dinner. Against our assumptions my veg friends got good options there. Later we went on a walk, the weather was a little cold but very pleasant. We tried a local beer called Bintang Pilsener and it was good, not too strong, not too mild. Here is a picture of it -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/beer.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

We then went to sleep hoping the sunrise at Mount Bromo would be worth it, because that is all we had after our trip to Ijen was replaced with Tumpak Sewu waterfall and I don't think anyone was really excited about the waterfall

### Day 2 (Mount Bromo Viewpoint - Mount Bromo Crater - Malang)

After waking up at 1:45 am we all met at the hotel lobby at around 2:35 am. There were at least 5 jeeps waiting there with other tourists rushing in as well in a bid to do what we all came for i.e reach first to the view point. It was about 40-45 minutes ride and we saw many more jeeps on our way heading in the same direction. We reached the view point at around 3:40 am after a short hike/walk and Mr Hamim asked us to <strong>wait till 5:15</strong> am there and not to let go of the front row spot till the sun rises. The weather was cold and we were left wondering if we wasted our sleep waking up so early just to wait there for another 90 minutes doing nothing. The sunrise as expected was beautiful and instead of adoring how beautiful it was, we started doing what every tourist does - getting ourselves clicked with mount bromo.

Here is the sunrise at that point -

Here is me trying to get a decent picture there -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/me-bromo.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

After the viewpoint we headed towards the crater. After another 30 minutes of downhill ride we arrived near the crater and decided to walk till the crater from here on. Here is a picture of us at that place -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/before-crater-walk.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

The walk was pleasant the views were great all around. The empty and <strong>barren terrain was very pretty</strong> and it reminded me of Spiti Valley in India. Have a look yourself

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/before-crater-view.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

On our way to the craters few school girls asked me and Chhavi for a picture. At first I thought they wanted me to take their picture but later I realized they wanted a picture with us. To be honest, that has never happened to us. Though surprisingly, it was a fun moment.

The uphill climb to the crater included some rocky patches & stairs before you end up at the top from where you can see/smell sulphur fumes. The view is good but it scared me when someone told me that animals are burnt alive in it as a part of sacrifice, something that has been in Indonesian culture. Here are some of the pictures of the top -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/crater1.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/crater2.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

Then we headed back to our hotel, had breakfast and some rest before starting our journey to Malang which was another 6-7 hours drive from Bromo. We spent most of that time playing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.ellen.psych&hl=en_IN">Psych</a> and trust me it is fun. We reached Malang at about 7pm and checked in to our hotel. We then planned what to do the following day as waterfall seemed boring and cliche. Out options were rafting, zoo, paragliding & waterfall so we stuck to waterfall only in the end and I am glad we did that.

I would like to mention the place we had dinner that night. It was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pizzacombiarema/">Pizza Combi</a> where our vegetarian companions spent at least 20 minutes trying to explain them that they only wanted vegetables in the pizza and no meat, egg, fish oil etc. But that's not the reason I want to mention this place. The reason was the food quality, it was pretty good and everyone enjoyed it. So if in Malang do try it out, here is the pic -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/pizza-combi.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

Later in night we had some beer, played Uno and called it a day.

### Day 3 (Tumpak Sewu Waterfall - Surabaya Airport)

We woke up early to and left for Tumpak Sewu waterfall at around 7:30 am. It took us about 4 - 4:30 hours to reach Gate 1 from where we had to trek downwards to see the waterfall. This is how it looks from the top -

The trek down was really fun as we had to make our way through thick forest, broken stairs & many water streams and that too wearing slippers. A couple of my friends slipped during their way down. Here are some of the pics of the trek -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/waterfall-trek1.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>
<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/waterfall-trek2.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

The waterfall in itself was simply majestic. Once you reach near the center it the <strong>winds get super crazy</strong>. They are blazing fast, pushing you back and are carrying water drops which feel more like needles as they hit your face. It was just impossible to get into the exact center of the waterfall. Here is one of the picture my friends took when we were as near to the waterfall as we could get -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/waterfall.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

Needless to say the experience was pretty astounding and we felt great that we didn't replace this waterfall tour with any other activities around Malang. Post that we started our journey back to Surabaya Airport. Later that night we went to Pizza hut where we tried this black crust pizza -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/black-pizza.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

We reached Surubaya at around 11pm. We booked Ibis on the domestic terminal only as we had our flights to Yogyakarta the following morning and our friends from Singapore were heading back. We bid goodbye to Mr Hamim and thanked him & the driver for their hospitality. We then later said goodbye to our friends before going to sleep

### Day 4 (Yogyakarta)

Now one mistake I made during planning this trip was book Yogyakarta for just 1 day. There is a lot that this city has to offer. From suspension bridges to jurassic style caves but somehow none of that was possible as we checked in around 12am and all these required a full day to visit. So we decided to visit one of the most visited places in Yogyakarta - The Prambanan Temple and it's the first time that we <strong>paid INR 1600/USD 25 to visit a temple</strong>. The temple was beautiful indeed, but when you come from India, you've already seen it all. Here is the pic of us there -

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/java/prambanan.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

Later in night we went to a beach and then headed back to our hotel to pack our bags for our flight back the next day. One of our friend left his phone at one of the currency exchange we stopped but unlike India he got it back when we returned back (after 1 hour). It's good to see good people all around. Also people like you who read my blog to the very end. Makes my day ;).
