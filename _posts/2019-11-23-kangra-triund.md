### Day 0 (Delhi - McLeodGanj)

Ok, if you have read any of my previous blogs, this part is mostly filled with boring and uninformative stuff about the onward journey to the first destination. But this one was definitely not boring and I bet you will learn a good lesson about Indian buses once you read it.

So we had booked an HRTC bus from Delhi that was supposed to leave exactly at 7:30 pm. Now a general belief is that Indian buses are always delayed so it's ok to come 10-15 minutes late, but trust me that is not true with government buses and especially not HRTC. Having experienced that in the past, I did warn my team to be on time for this one but unfortunately 3 members got late. In spite of us begging the driver to wait and later making him to at least drive slow to allow the fellow people to catch up, our friends failed to do so.
So they had to book a private taxi to Haveli Murthal, the first and only stop scheduled by our bus for dinner. I bet no one from our group is going to risk missing a government bus in the future :D :D.

Anyway from there on the thrill died and the journey was pretty much the usual, fun games and then sleep.

### Day 1 (McLeodGanj - Triund Top - 9km)

Given the punctuality of HRTC, we did reach McleodGanj on time at around 7 am, a little earlier than expected. We waited at the office of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/triund.lodge/about/">Triund Mountain Lodge and Camping</a> till our guide arrived. There was guesthouse on the 2nd level of the building and the owner was kind enough to allow us to use the restrooms provided we order something from his kitchen. We had a light breakfast, dumped extra stuff that we didn't want to carry in their office and then our guide provided us food for the journey and we were all set to get rolling.

Here is one of the pictures with a sweet message from the starting point in McLeodGanj:-

And here is our full group -

This trek is relatively easy, no wonder this is one of the treks loved by beginners, and you'll find decent Vistas all along. FYI Sadly, as it is frequently traveled you will also find garbage all along. But this 9km of the hike is all worth it when you reach the top.
It took us about 5hrs to reach the top, but we took too many breaks, I think it is easily doable in 3-4 hrs even if you are not a professional.

After getting a lot of pictures on the top, we finally were ready to check in to our camps but the weather started to drop real quick as the sun went down, we were offered a room in the guesthouse to rest while are camps were being made ready. Having found the comfort and warmth in the guesthouse we requested to stay in the room instead of trying our luck with camping(FYI - it was team call, I would have still preferred tents).
Few of the group members got too comfortable and just slept like there was no tomorrow. Others were showing their talents, one showed her flexibility as she moved her body from one side to other of a circle she made out of her hands while keeping keeping interlocked.

Before dinner got served one of our friends took the opportunity to mingle with an Australian group who was also out there camping on the same premises. She is a hoot and got all of them to try some Punjabi dance. Here is a video of her getting them to grove -

The Australians also tried to teach our group a traditional dance and too bad I don't remember its name :(.

After dinner, we had fun by having some in house dancing and playing Truth/Dare. The dares and stories we got to experience had to be one of the highlights of the trip.

### Day 2 (Triund Top - McLeodGanj - 9km)

To catch the morning views everyone woke up early. I personally woke up at around 5:00 am and was the first one to freshen up. Most of my group members were avoiding to freshen up as we had open field dugouts covered intents as our toilets.

Anyway mornings here were worth a while, you could just sit down and enjoy a picturesque view with cold breeze gushing in taking all your stress away. Here is a picture depicting a tiny bit of what I am trying to say -

We utilized such beautiful vistas by taking a lot of pictures there and then after breakfast started out journey back to Triund.

The downhill was smooth and we managed to get down within 3 hours I suppose. We decided to visit Bhagsu waterfall before picking our stuff and exploring McLeodGanj. Bhagsu waterfall was not at its prime but was a good resting point for everyone, here one of the group members overcame her fear of dogs and managed to pet one. Here is that moment captured -

After picking our bags, we did stop for dinner at the famous <strong>Tibet Kitchen</strong> in McLeodganj. The experience was a mix of good and bad but definitely I am not trying their Thukpa again. One funny incident that made us laugh was when one of our pure vegetarian friends tried a dessert (brownie I suppose) which had eggs. I bet she ain't going to try brownies either. After that, we had the worst Dimsums in the history of Dimsums right outside Tibet Kitchen.

And that was it, we boarded our bus and started our journey back home :)
