This trip was all about experiencing different landscapes that Gujarat had to offer

### Day 0 (Delhi - Ahmedabad)

We took a flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad which was 1hr flight and reached Ahmedabad at around 11pm. From there on our cab driver picked us up and we started our journey towards Kutch.

### Day 1 (Kutch)

We reached Kutch at around 8 am and it was too early for checking in to our camping tents so we decided to visit the famous white dessert first. It was about 5-7km away from our camps and requires permit to visit it. Luckily for us they let us go and only asked for our Aadhar card but I suggest inquirying it before and arranging a permit just in case its now allowed. We then parked at a point beyond which you were only allowed to walk or hire a horse/camel cart. The point looks like this :-

The walk seems small but was atleast 1-1.5km. You will start seeing the white dessert as you reach the halfway point but the main point looks like this :-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/rann_main_point.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

Everything after this is just plain white sand and its the best place to get your pictures clicked. Here is a video I took:-

**Word of caution**:- Don't be too adventurous, if you go beyond a certain point you will find quicksand.

After walking back, we had breakfast somewhere in the local market which turns into a festival in evening. I tried Dabeli here, something I had never had. Then we went on to checkin in our tents and slept till evening.

Evening was all about visiting the same place again, only difference was that there a lot of people around and place was all lit up. As it was getting cold we went back around 9pm, had our dinner and sat around the camp fire where our caretakers arranged from some tradition Gujarati folk music.

### Day 2 (Kutch-Kalo Dungar-Junagadh)

Day 2 was all about reaching as near to Gir Forest as we can as driving in dark was not allowed/considered safe there. So we decided to drive till Junagadh which is only 50-60 km away from Gir Forest. 

In morning we decided to visit the highest point of Kutch (Kalo Dungar) which also provides views to a beautiful lake that connects India and Pakistan. If you have time you can also visit **Dholavira which** is called Harappan city that had the **Harappan culture** dating back to 4500 years ago. Here is a view from top of Kalo Dungar :-

If traveling with kids I recommend buying this whistles that make bird noises from there. Its super cheap, It was Rs 30 per piece.

Rest of day went traveling to Junagadh where we reached at around 11pm (Almost 9hrs on road). The only thing to remember were the windmills on the way and the fight we had over the phone with the hotel manager of Diu who had us booked for that day instead of 30th. P.S. - Always take a written confirmation if you wire transfer these guys. 

### Day 3 (Gir Forest)

We left Junagadh at about 10 am after having our breakfast and within 3 hours of traveling on a not so great road to Gir we finally arrived at the resort and before even we checked in we ran across these beautiful kittens that were playing around :-

But we came here to witness bigger cats then that so we had the lunch in the resort itself and went to bus safari point. We reached there at around 4pm and were waiting for our bus to arrive after buying tickets which were pretty cheap for Indians (INR 190 per person) but is super expensive for foreigners ($50 per person). Then we boarded the safari bus which was basically a standard mini bus. The tour was only of about 30 minutes in which we saw some deers, nilgais, leapords & lions. Judging from the attitude of the animals it didn't feel like we were visiting them in their natural habitat but rather a forced/closed environment, much like a zoo. Here are few of of the pictures we took:-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/gir_leopard.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

We were not impressed but that is the case with most of the safari's in India. Then we headed back to the resort where we cycled, played some video games in their gaming zone, had dinner & enjoyed some camp fire and finally went to sleep.

### Day 4 (Diu)

Diu is also about 3hrs from Gir and best part of Diu was that it was a union territory that lies just outside Gujrat. That meant no restriction on buying alcohol. We were imagining it a peaceful version of Goa but to be honest we were dissapointed. The food we had at a restaurant ( I don't even remember the name ) was just the worst we had in Gujrat and yet most expensive.

Diu fort was just like any other fort in India but we did get some good pictures clicked there. Also I will remember it for a person who farted infront of my friend. We are probably going to remember it as Diu Fart rather then Diu Fort. Anyway here is a pic from the fort:-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/diu_fort.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

The main beach was not at all clean and the public sitting places were rather avoidable. But luckily near it was this cafe/restaurant **The Cats Eye Restaurant** which had decent food and we sat their most of the evening and then finally went back to our rooms and partied there. This is the view of entrance of the main beach :-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/nagoa_beach.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

***Note:- We didn't try other beaches, my friends tell me they are beautiful, so maybe you can try them.***

### Day 5 (Ahmedabad)

On our drivers request we left early in the morning at around 8 am but as expected we reached Ahemdabad in 8 hours and way before our flight. So we visited some local places there like :- 

1. **Sabarmati Ashram** - It was home to Gandhi. (Its actually very clean & beautiful) 
2. **Riverfront Park** - It is good if you want to do cycling by the water or want to do boating. But sadly even this place was not so clean as people were just throwing garbadge here & there :/.

Here is a pic of Kasturba Gandhi's (Mahatma Gandhi's wifes) chakra
