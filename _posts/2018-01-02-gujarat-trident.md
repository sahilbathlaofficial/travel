Has it ever happened to you that you want to plan a trip in last week of December but don't want to spend a fortune for it? It surely happened with us and after shortlisting many places we decided to visit Gujarat. As Amitabh Bachan famously quotes *"Kuch din to bitayein Gujarat me"*. This trip was all about experiencing different landscapes that Gujarat had to offer

### Day 0 (Delhi - Ahmedabad)

We took a flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad which was 1hr flight and reached Ahmedabad at around 11pm. From there on our cab driver picked us up and we started our journey towards Kutch.

### Day 1 (Kutch)

We reached Kutch at around 8 am, it was damn cold (about 7-8 degree celsius) and too early for checking in to our camping tents so we decided to visit the famous white dessert first. It was about 5-7 km away from our camps and requires permit to visit it. Luckily for us they let us go and only asked for our Aadhar card but I suggest inquiring it before and arranging a permit just in case its now allowed. We then parked at a point beyond which you were only allowed to walk or hire a horse/camel cart. The point looks like this :-

The walk seems small but was at least 1-1.5km. You will start seeing the white dessert as you reach the halfway point but the main point looks like this :-
<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/rann_main_point.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>
Everything after this is just plain white sand and it’s the best place to get your pictures clicked. Here is a video I took:-

**Word of caution**:- Don't be too adventurous, if you go beyond a certain point you will find quicksand.

After walking back, we had breakfast somewhere in the local market which turns into a festival in evening. I tried Dabeli here, something I had never had. We then we went on to checkin in our tents and slept till evening.

The temperature was about (25 degree celsius) by then and it got more hotter as we approached noon. So I suggest bringing in all kind of clothes as temperature vary a lot between day & night in Kutch. 

Evening was all about visiting the same place again, only difference was that there a lot of people around and place was all lit up. As it was getting cold we went back around 9pm, had our dinner and sat around the campfire. Our caretakers arranged for some tradition Gujarati folk music.

### Day 2 (Kutch-Kalo Dungar-Junagadh)

Day 2 was all about reaching as near to Gir Forest as we can as driving in dark was not allowed/considered safe there. So we decided to drive till Junagadh which is only 50-60 km away from Gir Forest.

In morning we decided to visit the highest point of Kutch (Kalo Dungar) which also provides views to a beautiful lake that connects India and Pakistan. If you have time you can also visit **Dholavira which** is called Harappan city that had the **Harappan culture** dating back to 4500 years ago. Here is a view from top of Kalo Dungar :-

If traveling with kids I recommend buying the whistles that make bird noises from there. It’s super cheap, It was INR 30 per piece.

Rest of day went traveling to Junagadh where we reached at around 11pm (Almost 9 hrs on road). The only thing to remember were the windmills on the way and the fight we had over the phone with the hotel manager of Diu who had us booked for that day instead of 30th. P.S. - Always take a written confirmation if you wire transfer these guys.

### Day 3 (Gir Forest)

We left Junagadh at about 10 am after having our breakfast and within 3 hours of traveling on a not so great road to Gir we finally arrived at the resort and before even we checked in we ran across these beautiful kittens that were playing around :-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/gir_kittens.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

But we came here to witness bigger cats then that so we had the lunch in the resort itself and went to bus safari point. We only took the bus safari because private jeep safari’s were sold out, so plan months ahead if you want to visit Gir and want a private safari. We reached there at around 4pm and were waiting for our bus to arrive after buying tickets which were pretty cheap for Indians (INR 190 per person) but is super expensive for foreigners ($50 per person). Then we boarded the safari bus which was basically a standard mini bus. The tour was only of about 30 minutes in which we saw some deers, nilgais, leopards and lions. Judging from the attitude of the animals it didn't feel like we were visiting them in their natural habitat but rather a forced/closed environment, much like a zoo. Here are few of of the pictures we took:-

We were not impressed but that is the case with most of the safari's in India. Then we headed back to the resort where we cycled, played some video games in their gaming zone, had dinner & enjoyed some campfire and finally went to sleep.

### Day 4 (Diu)

Diu is about 3hrs from Gir and best part of Diu was that it was a union territory that lies just outside Gujarat. That meant no restriction on buying alcohol. We were imagining it a peaceful version of Goa but to be honest we were disappointed. The food we had at a restaurant ( I don't even remember the name ) was just the worst we had in this trip and yet most expensive.

Diu fort was just like any other fort in India but we did get some good pictures clicked there. Also I will remember it for a person who farted in front of my friend. We are probably going to remember it as Diu Fart rather than Diu Fort. Anyway here is a pic from the fort:-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/fort_diu.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

The main beach was not at all clean and the public sitting places were rather avoidable. But luckily near it was this cafe/restaurant **The Cats Eye Restaurant** which had decent food and we sat there most of the evening and then finally went back to our rooms and partied there. This is the view of entrance of the main beach :-

<div style="width:100%;text-align:center"><img src="/img/gujarat/nagoa_beach.jpg" style="width:80%" /></div>

***Note:- We didn't try other beaches, my friends tell me they are beautiful. So if you plan on visiting Diu go look for them.***

### Day 5 (Ahmedabad)

On our drivers request we left early in the morning at around 8 am but as expected we reached Ahmedabad in 8 hours and way before our flight. So we visited some local places there like :- 

1. **Sabarmati Ashram** - It was home to Gandhi. (It's actually very clean & beautiful) 
2. **Riverfront Park** - It is good if you want to do cycling by the water or want to do boating. But sadly even this place 
was not so clean as people were just throwing garbage here & there :/.

Here is a pic of Kasturba Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi's wife's) chakra
