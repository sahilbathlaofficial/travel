### Day 0 (Delhi - Kasol)

We booked our first outing from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gotrippytrip/" style="color:#055cab">GoTripyTrip</a>. Everyone from my office gathered at the Metro Cafe on Rajouri Garden Metro station at around 8pm. We took an outstation mini bus(tempo traveler) from Delhi - Kasol. The ride was filled with a lot of fun filled games like Dumb Charades, Mafia, Uno and a new game called Find the Lost Money as one of my colleague lost her 500 INR and everyone got busy finding it. At the end we did find it by replacing another 500 note, mission accomplished :).

### Day 1 (Kasol)

The drive to Kasol was damn slow and it took us over 18hrs to reach there, seriously, I could have run faster than that, ok just kidding, but that was super slow. Anyhow the resort we stayed in made up for it. The resort was Kasol Heights and it had a very good vibe. It had a good playing area, a mini swimming pool and some trance loving people that day. Here is a video of it -

In evening we went to explore the market for good food but unfortunately we only found about 15 pieces of Dimsums for 10+ of us. We were disappointed by that but not by the stuff we scored. Then we went back to our resort to grab the free buffet dinner and have some drinks before calling it a night.

Though after a good dinner and drinks we ended up staying for few hours playing Antakshari. Here is the video of that -

And that was our day.

### Day 2 (Kasol - Kheerganga 10-11km)

We woke up early at around 8:00 am, got ready, had breakfast and headed for the trek around 11:30 am. Here is the starting point of the trek from Barshaini(a small village near Kasol). Here is a picture of the starting point -

I remember a small incident that happened during the start of the trek. A sage stopped us and told us that the girls in our group won't be able to make it, but trust me that turned out to be catalyst in getting them all pumped for this trek, so thankyou Sage Baba :D.
Ok so the hike itself wasn't so tough but the damage caused by frequent rains made it a little difficult. You could find slippery paths, fallen trees and overflowing water streams everywhere. Here is one such incident -

This was the first trek of many of my colleagues and there was different reaction towards it by different people. There were few who were enjoying the trail and were racing ahead as if the world was ending and then there were few lagging behind and praying to god to reach the top sooner than later.

After struggling for about 6 hours in moderate rainfall and with very heavy legs and hearts we did manage to reach the top and trust me this picture does no justice to how tired everyone was -

We then spent our evening by doing a campfire, smoking some good stuff and sharing stories from our past. The stories started from life events/relationships and soon changed its genre to horror and thriller. Even after the campfire ended, our stories didn't.

### Day 3 (Kheerganga - Kasol - 10-11km)

The motive of the day was to wake up at 5 am, watch sunrise and then go take bath in the hot springs of sulphur in Kheerganga top and head back. But thanks to midnight gossip only 2 people including me woke up on time. Unfortunately the peaks hid the sunrise and if you planning to watch sunrise, you guys can safely skip it.
But once everyone woke up we did manage to go to the hot springs and have a good bath. Word of caution in case you want to go for a bath, the surface is too slippery due to sulphur, so mind your steps.

On our way back the boys of our group decided to head towards the camp hoping the girls will find their way to camp as easily as they did. But guess what? They didn't, it took them about 30 minutes to reach the camp and they were hell scared. Lesson learned - stick together team.


We did take some good pictures, and here is the full gang -

After having breakfast we started our descent to Kasol.The rain was pretty heavy and made it very difficult to trek down as everyone was slipping a lot.
We did take a different route back to Kasol which was more scenic with views of Ganga River in form of Kheer(White Milk) and a beautiful waterfall.

We were able to trek down in about 4.5 hours but had to wait for atleast 90 more minutes for others to catch up. What actually happened was that 2 guys decided to take a break and grab some tea while others just waited and waited for them to catch up. The girls in those who were waiting started crying assuming something bad happened as it was raining pretty heavily as the whole path was more slippery than a butter in a frying pan.
Fortunately nothing happened and the incident ended with everyone making a good laugh about it.

Here is a picture of that -

After reaching back, we started our journey back to Delhi. We did take a halt at Manikaran where everyone visited the Gurdawara and cherished a wonderful Langar in dinner in form of blessings. And that's that, a delightful trek topped with great bonding with my team made it one of the best treks I had for long.
