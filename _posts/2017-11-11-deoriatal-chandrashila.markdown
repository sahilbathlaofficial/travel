Are you looking for a weekend getaway from New Delhi, India and are looking for a trek that is not so strenuous but yet beautiful then this article might be worth your time. Now if you google Deoriatal Chandrashila Peak Trek you would find out that this trek is probably going to take your more than 3 days. But we did it in 2 days and that to without stressing it out and I am going to tell you how, so keep reading :)

### Quick Synopsis

*Trek Duration* - 2 days<br/>
*Trek Distance* - 2.5km for Sari-Deoriatal, 5.5 km for Chopta-Chandrashila<br/>
*Trek Beauty* - 3/5 stars<br/>

### Day 0 (Delhi - Haridwar)

We took a bus from Delhi Kashmiri Gate ISBT on 27th November (Friday) at around 9 pm in the night and arrived Haridwar in morning around 3 am. There we stayed at Gaytritirth Shanti Kunj Ashram where one of my friend Arun grew up.

### Day 1 (Haridwar-Deoriatal-Chopta)

At around 6:30 - 7:00am we began our journey from Haridwar to Sari Village which is the base camp for Deoriatal. After taking 1 halt for breakfast we arrived at the base camp at about 2:30pm so that's 7 hours effectively but yes you can do it in less if you don't want any break. We had something to eat at a food joint just at the starting point of the trek and starting our ascend at about 3:00 pm.

Here is the place from where you will be starting your 2.5km hike to Deoriatal.

The distance to top sure seems as an easy aspect but just a word of caution the whole 2.5km is a steep walk on a cemented pathway. So if you are not okay with it I suggest taking breaks in every 500 meters or whatever you are comfortable with. One of my friend who was trekking for the first time gave up on the first 500 meters itself and went back to the starting point. The rest of us kept going & it took us about 1 hour to reach the top though and yes the lake/tal was beautiful.

We spent about 30 minutes near the tal & had some tea in a food joint just before it and then headed back downwards. It took us about 25-30 minutes to reach back to our car from where we headed to Chopta which was another 30-40 minutes. After reaching there we rented a room at Moksha Cafe which costed us only Rs 800 for all 5 of us. We settled in around 6 pm. It was already dark here as the sun had almost set and there was no proper source of electricty in Chopta. They had few lights on which were running on solar energy.

We spent that day playing cards and talking about the possible snakes in that area and telling stories of awkward confortations in our previous treks and eventually went to sleep at around 10pm.

### Day 2 (Chopta-Tugnath-Chandrashila-Chopta-Rishikesh)

In the morning after heaving some light breakfast we headed for our trek from Chopta's base point to Tugnath Temple and eventually Chandrashila. This is where the trek officially starts:-

Again it was a steep cemented pathway (probably not as steep as Deoriatal) from Chopta to Tugnath which was about 4-5km. One of my friend decided to walk slow as he just interested in reaching Tugnath and not Chandrashila. The rest of us wanted to complete the whole round trip in 5-6 hrs. We reached the temple at around 9:00 - 9:15 am and it was very peaceful inspite of being closed in that season. Here is how it looks like :-

After taking a break for about 30 minutes and clicking a lot of photos we started our last stretch of about 1.5km from Tugnath - Chandrashila top. The only difference was the path was not cemented and not so wide anymore so it was slightly difficult to ascend but we reached there on the top around 10:00 am (30 minutes from Tugnath). The views were pleasent to the eyes and the feeling of reaching a peak of a hill was just great. This is what I did after reaching the peak :-

At around 10:30am we started our descend and reached back to the starting point around 12:15.We ran out of water during the ascend which was surely needed during this descend, so do carry ample water for yourself. After reaching back we headed to Rishikesh almost immediately an reach there around 6:30 pm after just stopping for lunch. From there we took a bus back to Delhi.
